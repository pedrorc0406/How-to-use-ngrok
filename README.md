## What is ngrok?
Ngrok is a developer tool which translates your localhost, for example http://12.0.2.2:5400, into a public url ,for example https://xxxxx.ngrok-free.app. Ngrok was originally developed by **Alan Shreve**, who launched it in 2013 as a personal project. Later on, Alan founded a company also called ngrok, Inc., which continued to develop the service, offering both free and paid versions with additional features like authentication, custom domains, and more tools for developers.
